This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and involves issues with the project's build process, package dependencies, or the Expo environment itself.  It's not a specific, easily identifiable error message but rather a category of problems. For example, you might encounter a generic error message from the build system or a dependency-related issue that doesn't provide clear clues.
