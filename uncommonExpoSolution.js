Debugging these issues typically involves:

1. **Carefully review the complete error output:** Expo CLI errors sometimes provide hints within long error messages or stack traces.  Look for details about missing modules, incorrect configurations, or other problems.
2. **Check your package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible with your project and Expo SDK version. Run `expo install` to install or update dependencies.
3. **Clean and rebuild:** Try clearing the cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuilding your project.
4. **Verify environment variables:** Make sure environment variables required by Expo or your project are properly set.
5. **Inspect Expo configuration:** Review the `app.json` or `expo.json` files for potential configuration issues or typos.
6. **Examine logs:**  Consult the Expo development logs or the terminal output for more detailed information about the error.
7. **Search for similar issues:** Use the Expo documentation, community forums, or online search engines to see if others have reported similar problems and found solutions.
8. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If you're still stuck, try to isolate the problematic code into a smaller, self-contained example to make it easier to diagnose the error.
