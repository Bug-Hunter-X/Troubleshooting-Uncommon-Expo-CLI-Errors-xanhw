# Troubleshooting Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates a common problem category encountered when using the Expo CLI:  uncommon and difficult-to-diagnose errors. These errors aren't associated with a specific error message but rather a range of problems during the build or development process. 

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file simulates one such scenario (e.g., a dependency conflict or misconfiguration), while `uncommonExpoSolution.js` provides solutions.
